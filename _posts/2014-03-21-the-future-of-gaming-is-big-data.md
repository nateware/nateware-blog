I gave a talk at GDC 2014 on about game analytics and AWS.  Much of the talk was
focused on building an analytics pipeline using AWS services like Redshift,
Kinesis, and Elastic MapReduce.  But at the end I blabbed a bit about the future of
gaming: Big data and real-time analytics.

Free-to-play has taken hold as one of the main publishing strategies for games,
especially mobile and social games. It's widely known that succeeding in this
space requires having good analytics on your players, so you know what they love
and what they hate.  Having an awesome game has always been about maximizing the
love and minimizing the hate. Charge a reasonable price for the things your players
love and you have a simple but effective monetization strategy.

So how do you know what they love?
----------------------------------
The only reliable way to tell what players love is by analyzing their actual 
behavior.  You can't get there by asking them.  [There's some wonderful psychological
research]() that shows people change their answers when you ask them questions, to
provide more socially acceptable answers.
