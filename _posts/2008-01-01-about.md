I lead the Amazon San Diego Software Dev Center.  Housing a bit over 200 people as of early 2018, I was the first employee and founder of the office.

Previously I was a Principal Solutions Architect for AWS at Amazon.  I traveled worldwide and gave talks on AWS best practices.

Hope you enjoy my blog.
