Many people go their whole lives without finding their 
[doppleganger](http://www.answers.com/doppelganger "look it up!"), but not me.
By chance last weekend I picked up a New York Times and flipped to the Business
section. There, staring back at me, was this!

I've been so absent-minded lately, that I thought it may actually _be_ me. Did I go to London
last week to protest? That would explain the hangover. If it wasn't me, who was this socialist
protester, this anti-Nate that had surfaced? I mean, I know I'm part British, but I didn't
realize it was _that_ big a part.

Then I had this fantasy that I was, come nightfall, some type of socialist secret agent,
something straight out of the Cold War, leading an underground movement to topple world
governments. Then I realized: that would be an awesome idea for a TV show. I could get somebody
handsome, maybe a bit dark - like 
[Christian Slater](http://crime.about.com/od/famousdiduno/ig/celebrity_mugshots/slaterchristian.htm "ok maybe not THAT dark") - to play me. As usual, somebody
