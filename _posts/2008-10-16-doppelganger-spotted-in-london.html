Many people go their whole lives without finding their <a title="look it up!" href="http://www.answers.com/doppelganger">doppelganger</a>, but not me.  By chance last weekend I picked up a New York Times and flipped to the Business section. There, staring back at me, was this!
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://nateware.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/newspaper-nate1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7 aligncenter" title="My doppelganger... we ARE related!" src="http://nateware.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/newspaper-nate1.jpg?w=573&amp;h=480" alt="" width="573" height="480" /></a></p>
I've been so absent-minded lately, that I thought it may actually <em>be</em> me. Did I go to London last week to protest? That would explain the hangover. If it wasn't me, who was this socialist protester, this anti-Nate that had surfaced? I mean, I know I'm part British, but I didn't realize it was <em>that</em> big a part.

Then I had this fantasy that I was, come nightfall, some type of socialist secret agent, something straight out of the Cold War, leading an underground movement to topple world governments. Then I realized: that would be an awesome idea for a TV show. I could get somebody handsome, maybe a bit dark - like <a title="ok maybe not THAT dark" href="http://crime.about.com/od/famousdiduno/ig/celebrity_mugshots/slaterchristian.htm">Christian Slater</a> - to play me. As usual, somebody <a title="Sponsored by Chevy?" href="http://www.nbc.com/My_Own_Worst_Enemy/">stole my idea</a>.
