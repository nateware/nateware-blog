Unlike [my blog redesign trauma](jekyll-plus-twitter-bootstrap-on-s3.html),
setting up my 2008 Mac Pro as a media server was the easiest computer-related
adventure I've been on in a decade.  I now have a hands-off, headless server
that handles Blurays, CDs, and downloads, and serves movies and music to my
TV's, laptops, and iPads throughout the house.

When I was first wading through the normal 90% noise-to-signal ratio
of the internet, I was prepared for having to wipe my Mac, install
Windows 7 on it, and run Windows Media Center with a bunch of XBox 360's
as clients, to read the content.  iPads were largely SOL and there were
a bunch of hacks to get other devices working, but it was thoroughly
depressing.

Eventually I stumbled on this [Plex Step-by-Step for MakeMKV on Mac OSX](
http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Blu_Ray_Rips#OS_X) that gave me hope.
The eventual combination of hardware and software I landed on was:

* [LG 14X Blu-ray Reader-Writer + DVDRW-CDRW](http://eshop.macsales.com/item/LG/WH14NS40MP/) from OWC
* [Plex Media Server for Mac](http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Downloads#Mac_OS_X_-_PMS) to serve content
* [MakeMKV for Mac](http://www.makemkv.com/download/) to rip Blurays
* On client devices - [Plex Media Center](http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Downloads#Plex_Media_Center_.28PMC_-_standalone_client.29) for Mac/PC, and there are versions on the Google Play
and Apple App Store as well
